It took almost 3 hours to get to the top and it was worth it. The view was a reward. That’s why I wanted to create a place where people can rest and enjoy the view. First I elevated grassland to make a flat viewing platform with glass pavilion containing restaurant and staircase. Below the platform there is small spa, room with fireplace to integrate with others. On the lowest level there are actual hostel rooms. Elevation is made of wood to blend with environment. "
